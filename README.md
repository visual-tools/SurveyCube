The original Evaluation Survey framework was made by Andy Gibson and developed into a digital tool by Christopher Reay an John Kellas.

Andy Gibson is the academic lead for People in Health West of England (www.phwe.org.uk), a regional public involvement network that supports public involvement in research. He developed this framework as a way of thinking about and evaluating public involvement.
